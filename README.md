# Dunwich Type Proofs

These proofing files were developed by James Puckett of Dunwich Type Founders. Some bits and ideas were picked out of old Typophile posts by other people.

These files are provided under the MIT License.

All files are in Indesign format. .indd files are CS2014 format, use .idml files for older versions of Indesign. 

Devanagari files use the Rhodium Libre typeface available at: https://github.com/DunwichType/RhodiumLibre

What’s in the repo:
* Baseline: Files I use for proofing mostly-complete fonts

* Comparisons: looping files for comparing fonts and styles. Mac users should skip these and use House Industries GlyphProofer, available at: https://github.com/houseind/robothon/tree/master/GlyphProofer

* Diacritical Marks: 
• The forms file is for reviewing letterforms. 
• The words list is a list of real words containing the marks at the beginning, inside, and end of a word. 
• The combining diacriticals proof is intended for accented letters created on the fly with combining diacritical marks. It is not completely comprehensive as I am just starting to implement this in my own work. I recommend that you use this to compare your work with Tiro Typework’s Brill fonts: http://www.brill.com/about/brill-fonts
• The UNtext is a sample of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in numerous languages.

* Mockups: Sample layouts for previewing running copy.

* Prototyping: These files are for proofing unfinished alphabets.

* QA: This proof is for testing a final font to make sure lots of stuff works.

* Miscellaneous
• The common English words proof includes hundreds of English words that commonly appear on magazine covers and packages of household goods. It would be great if people would contribute similar lists for other languages, especially the Devanagari languages!

* Devanagari: These are similar to the Latin files, with brute force proofs for two-consonant conjuncts and some localization proofs for Marathi and Nepali.
