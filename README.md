# Dunwich Type Proofs

These proofing files were developed by James Puckett of Dunwich Type Founders. Some bits and ideas were picked out of old Typophile posts by other people.

These files are provided under the MIT License.

All files are in Indesign CS 2014 format.

Devanagari files use the Rhodium Libre typeface available at: https://github.com/DunwichType/RhodiumLibre

I am aware that Adobe Indesign is not open-source software so don’t waste my time complaining about the file format. 

What’s in the repo:
* Baseline: Files I use for proofing mostly-complete fonts.

* Comparisons: looping files for comparing fonts and styles. Mac users should skip these and use House Industries GlyphProofer, available at: https://github.com/houseind/robothon/tree/master/GlyphProofer

* Diacritical Marks: The forms file is for reviewing letterforms. The words list is a list of real words containing the marks at the beginning, inside, and end of a word. The UNtext is a sample of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in numerous languages.

* Mockups: Sample layouts for previewing running copy.

* Prototyping: These files are for proofing unfinished alphabets.

* QA: This proof is for testing a final font to make sure lots of stuff works.

* Devanagari: These are similar to the Latin files, with brute force proofs for two-consonant conjuncts and some localization proofs for Marathi and Nepali.
